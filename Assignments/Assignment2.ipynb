Built you program out of small elements, one expression and one line at a time, each of which you check. This will save you time later  when you otherwise have a hard time finding bugs.\n",

Each of the $n$ steps advance by $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ which each are randomly chosen to be -0.5 or +0.5. Make a plot of the random walk using square markers where the colour of each marker is decided by the step number that generated it.\n"
