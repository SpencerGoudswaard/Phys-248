    "1. The mass of one $\\mathrm{^4He}$ is $4.002602\\mathrm{u}$ where u is the atomic mass. Using the mass of the proton  calculte the mass difference between four protons and one $\\mathrm{^4He}$.\n",
    "2. Calculate the energy that corresponds to this mass difference using the formular $E = mc^2$. Express in erg.\n",
    "3. The sun is 4.603 billion years old. It shines with the luminosity one $L_\\odot$. Luminosity is energy per unit time. Calculate the amount of energy that the sun has been emitting since birth by assuming that the luminosity of the sun has been exactly the same compared to what it is today. Express in erg.\n",
    "4. Considering that four protons need to undergo nuclear reactions into $\\mathrm{^4He}$ in order to release the energy calculated in (2), how much total mass of protons has to undergo reactions to generate the total amount of energy the sun has generated so far under the assumption made in (3)?\n",
